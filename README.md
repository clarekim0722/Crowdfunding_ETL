# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Overview 
For the ETL mini project, I practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After I transformed the data, I created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

## Task Summary
-Extracted and transformed crowdfunding and contact data from Excel files
-Created and exported Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contact DataFrames as CSV files
-Designed an ERD and table schema for the database
-Created and populated PostgreSQL database tables

## Usage
-Run the Jupyter Notebook to extract and transform data, and create CSV files.
-Use the provided crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file to create tables in the PostgreSQL database.
-Load the CSV files into the corresponding PostgreSQL tables.
-Query the database to verify the data has been loaded correctly.

## Tools Used
-Python
-Pandas
-PostgreSQL
-Jupyter Notebook
